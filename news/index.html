        <p>Hello new Handibotter! You've gotten one of our first Handibot (V2) Adventure Tools and we look forward to working with you. Not only is the Adventure Edition an all new Handibot, but you are one of the first users of the FabMo digital fabrication platform for running digital fab equipment.</p>
        <p>We'll be using this NEWS App to keep you posted on what we expect to be a pretty fast-evolving resource system.</p>
        <p><em>Welcome to the Adventure!</em></p>

      <h4>Heads-Up on MACROS</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Macros are a bit of a work in progress. We have been updating them to remove a few bugs and to add more functionality. You'll want to make sure you have the latest installed on your tool.</p>
        <p>To install the latest set of Macros, download the the Macro Install App for your tool (e.g. V2 or V1update) from <a href="http://docs.handibot.com/apps/index.html">here (at docs.handibot.com)</a>, then add it as an App from the home screen. When you run the Install App you'll have the option of installing all the Macros or just individual Macros. You can leave the App on your tool to re-install Apps again, or you can delete it. You can always get the most up-to-date Macros and Apps from the docs page.</p>
        <p><em>Let us know if you have any problems.</em></p>
