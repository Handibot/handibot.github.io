# handibot.github.io

##Basics
This is the source for the Handibot.docs system that provides Support Resources for the Handibot website and for Handibot Apps running in the FabMo system on Handibot tools.

##Organization
The current versions of help files with their common, calling-names can be found in the doc-output folder. The names here match the names used by apps and should be maintained. The current master version of each of these files, along with previously public versions, can be found in doc-archive. Actual source documentation for this work is maintained by Handibot staff at another site. 

##Posting New Doc
Copy new doc with full name to both doc-output and doc-archive folders. In doc-output, delete the existing version of the doc, and rename new doc to the common calling name.
